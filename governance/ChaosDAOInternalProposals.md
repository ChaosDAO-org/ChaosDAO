# Internal ChaosDAO Governance Procedures

Proposals should support the mission and values of ChaosDAO. They should be well thought out and actionable or enforceable.

## Governance Tracks

There are several types of proposals that can be made within ChaosDAO. Some should be easier to pass in order to make governance easy and fluid, while some proposals will be more sensitive or controversial and therefore might require longer voting periods or higher voter turnout. Some topics will be reserved for DAOists to decide, while as many topics as possible will be opened up Regulars. When first introduced, this ChaosDAO "Gov 2.0" will be a work in progress with additional refinements needed in the future. After that "fluid experimental" phase is over, new tracks should be added via a proposal and consensus vote.

Governance Tracks:
* **Treasury spending**
  * Regulars can bring up topics and participate in discussions, but voting is reserved for DAOists only.
* **Nomination Pools and OpenGov Voting**
  * Can be discussed and voted on by all Regulars and DAOists.
* **Promotions and Demotions**
  * **Invites**
    * The invite process will remain the same as it currently is (unless changed via referendum), whereby Regulars or DAOists can propose new invitees within the #Invite-Proposals channel, and then the Scouts vote on whether or not to invite the new member within the role gated #talent-scout forum.
  * **Promotion to Regular**
    * Can be raised, discussed and voted on by all Regulars and DAOists.
  * **DAOist Promotions and Elections**
    * Can be raised, discussed and voted on only by DAOists.
* **Discord channel organization**
  * Can be discussed and voted on by all Regulars and DAOists.
* All other topics are reserved for the discretion of DAOists, but can be proposed by Regulars.

Each type of track likely should have a different voting period, and possibly different thresholds. However, much like the OpenGov implementation, it is quite hard to predict these things without experimentation. As such, we will start with votes being open for a period of **3 days**, with the possibility of being fast tracked by the DAOists.


## Turning Discussions into Official Proposals

General internal governance discussion takes place in the #int-gov-general-chat channel. There you can spitball ideas, shitpost, and get your complaints out.

Once a specific proposal is ready for targeted discussion and refinement of specific proposal parameters, proposers should introduce the topic in a new #int-gov-discussion forum thread. Some quick single-parameter votes can be held to gather information, even including multiple options for people to vote between. That provides insight into what exactly the single official proposal should include. This phase is important to avoid people suggesting modifications to an official proposal, since we don't want to change the contents of an official proposla once people have already begun voting on it.

Once the details of a proposal are finalized, a member in good standing (not in jail) with rights to propose and vote on the topic (according to its track) should introduce it as a new post in the #int-gov-proposals forum with only a single up/down/abstain vote (like for on-chain referenda). These are official proposals that will be enacted if successful.

Within the dedicated “INT GOVERNANCE” category within the ChaosDAO Discord server are the following channels:
* **invite-proposals**
* **int-gov-general-chat**
  * A place for less structured chat about internal governance
  * Frens can read/write here
* **int-gov-discussion** (forum style)
  * Used to initially raise a discussion about a particular issue. Titles should be descriptive and the forum shall be managed / kept organized by the DAOists. Regulars should follow the housekeeping rules set by the DAOists.
  * Frens are able to comment on discussions also. (If they are active and constructive enough, they might get promoted to Regular so that they can vote.)
* **int-gov-proposals** (forum style)
  * This is used to raise a vote / referendum about internal governance issues in tracks that both Regulars and DAOists can vote on.
  * All referenda should be fully detailed and include a detailed implementation/action plan. DAOists are allowed to veo or remove any referendum which does not satisfy this.
  * Frens are not able to view the proposal forum simply because the Discord implementation does not prevent people from adding to emojis that have already been made. In the future, if we implement a role-based voting bot in the server, this might be possible because the bot will enforce emoji voting permissions based on role.
* **int-daoist-proposals** (forum style)
  * This is used to raise a vote / referendum about internal governance issues in tracks that only DAOists can vote on. Not visible to Regular and Frens (mostly so that they can’t emoji vote).


## How to Vote

Voters use **emojis** (usually thumbs up/down) to vote on a proposal.
* Using a thread within a normal channel, voting is done on the initial post so that the votes are visible before entering the thread. This works because all emoji votes are visible.
* If posting as a new topic in a Discord "forum", due to Discord's design only the first emoji symbol used will show a total at the top level in the list of forum topics. Therefore for anything other than a simple thumbs-up vote in a forum topic, the voting should happen in one of the first comments in that discussion topic to avoid any bias for/against a particular outcome.

## How many votes to win?

Voting follows the same process as the OpenGov voting, whereby a majority of **66.7%+** must be achieved in order for a referendum to pass. If this is not achieved, the referendum is not enacted, but may be raised again if deemed necessary. This 66.7% is of the actual votes cast during the referendum, not 66% of the total eligible voters. The types of vote available will be the same as the OpenGov votes; thumbs_up, thumbs_down, abstain, and watching. DAOist and Regular votes carry the **same weight**.

Specialized DAOist roles such as DAOerRanger, PRteam, etc do not alter the voting rights of the DAOists. Although DAOerRangers have more abilities within the Discord server in order to administer it, all important changes must still be proposed and passed by DAOists and/or Regulars according to the guildelines laid out aboe.
