## How to Propose?
Generally, proposals often need some initial discussion to hammer specific proposal parameters. In those cases, DAOists should first bring up proposal topics in a new #daist-forum discussion thread. Some quick single-parameter votes can be held, even including multiple options for people to vote between. That provides insight into what exactly the proposal should include.

Once the details of a proposal are hammered out, a DAOist should make a new post in the #proposals forum with only a single up/down vote (like for on-chain referenda).

## How to Vote
Voters use emojis (usually thumbs up/down) to vote on a proposal.
* Using a thread within a normal channel, voting is done on the initial post so that the votes are visible before entering the thread. This works because all emojie votes are visible.
* If posting as a new topic in a Discord "forum", Only the first emoji symbol used will show a total at the top level in the list of forum topics. Therefore for anything other than a simple thumbs-up vote in a forum topic, the voting should happen in one of the first comments in that discussion topic to avoid any bias for/against a particular outcome. 

## How many votes to win?
All important votes must secure affirmative votes from at least half of the DAOists in order to pass. For quick or low importance votes, a lower threshhold can be used as long as at least a third of DAOists have voted (>7) and none has expressed opposition to the proposal. There are no hard guidelines regarding the duration of votes, but they tend to be open at least 24 hours and occassionally stretch out to a week if there's not enough participation.

Specialized DAOist roles such as DAOerRanger, PRteam, etc do not alter the voting rights of the DAOists. Although DAOerRangers have more rights within the Discord server in order to administer it, all important changes must still be proposed and passed by the full panel of DAOists.
