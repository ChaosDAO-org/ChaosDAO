# Types of Proposals

Proposals should support the mission and values of ChaosDAO. They should be well thought out and actionable or enforceable.

There are several types of proposals that can be made within ChaosDAO. Some should be easier to pass in order to make governance easy and fluid, while some proposals would be more sensitive or controversial and therefore require longer voting period, higher voter turnout and vote totals. Some topics will be reserved for DAOists to decide, while as many topics as possible will be opened up to Regulars also. When first introduced, this ChaosDAO "Gov 2.0" will be a work in progress with additional refinements needed in the future.

Governance Tracks:
* Treasury spending
  * Regulars can participate in discussions, but voting is reserved for DAOists only.
* Nomination Pools and Voting Pools
  * Can be discussed and voted on by all Regulars and DAOists.
* Promotions and Demotions:
  * Invites
    * Two discussion areas provided. One for Scouts (DAOists) only to vote in. One that is also accessible by Regulars so that they can propose new invitees and contribute to evaluations of those individuals.
  * Promotion to Regular
    * Can be discussed and voted on by all Regulars and DAOists.
  * DAOist Promotions and Elections
    * Discussed and voted on only by DAOists
* Discord channel organization
  * Can be discussed and voted on by all Regulars and DAOists.
* All other topics are reserved for the discretion of DAOists.

Anyone within ChaosDAO can suggest a proposal within any channel, but only those with voting rights may formally submit the proposal according to the restrictions in the tracks listed above.
