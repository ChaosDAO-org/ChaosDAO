# Channel Structure

The goals when structuring the channels within the ChaosDAO discord server are:
* Allow each major topic a separate isolated space (channel) to maintain cohesive conversations.
* Minimize the overall number of channels within the server in order to reduce how overwhelming and unreadable it feels.
* Maximize transparency and availability of information within the server by making all of the general discussion channels visible to everyone.
* Provide a means or time sensitive information to be quickly distributed (such as alpha leaks)

Therefore a few specific channel management strategies have been:
* Polkadot/Kusama parachain teams or projects get a single channel for both their DOT and KSM chains. Parachains do not get a channel until they win a slot auction. Until then, their upcoming slot auction bidding (crowdloan) will be discussed in the crowdloan channel.
* Project existence alone does not quality them to have a dedicated channel. If there is not much interest in certain parachains (like Listen, Dora, Parallel), a channel may never be created because there's not enough server communication about the project to warrant isolating it in a dedicated channel. And some projects that become inactive or disband can have their channel archived. Archived channels are not deleted but will only be visible to DAOists. Examples are Genshiro/Equilibrium and Rome.

Exceptions where channels have restricted visibility:
* If ChaosDAO members have pooled funds and therefore may need to collectively bargain with parties who might also be ChaosDAO members (in particular, collators), a dedicated private channel will be created within ChaosDAO which is only visible to the contributors and server admins (not even DAOists).
* All Regulars have access to a channel not visible to Frens.
* DAOists have restricted DAOist-only channels where they discuss invited, policy proposals, initiatives, and generally bullshit with each other since these are usually more sensitive discussions.
