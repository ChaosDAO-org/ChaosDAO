# Jail

Members who have committed serious offenses against the DAO (paper handsing flagship NFTs, for example) will be jailed. They will be relegated to #jail, and their access to all other channels will be revoked until their sentence has been served.

Jailed members may exit jail early by either a) bribing the guards or b) getting bailed out by another member.
