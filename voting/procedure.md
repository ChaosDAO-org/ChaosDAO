# Procedure

The 20-24 DAOists form the governance body of ChaosDAO.

In order to initiate a policy proposal to be voted on, a DAOist creates a post in the #proposals channel. A thread is used to contain all discussion about the proposal. Recently, the Discord "forum" feature was introduced so that proposals are each a thread within the forum.

DAOists use emojis (usually thumbs up/down) to vote on the proposal. All important votes must secure affirmative votes from at least half of the DAOists in order to pass. For quick or low importance votes, a lower threshhold can be used as long as at least a third of DAOists have voted (>7) and none has expressed opposition to the proposal. There are no hard guidelines regarding the duration of votes, but they tend to be open at least 24 hours and occassionally stretch out to a week if there's not enough participation.

Specialized DAOist roles such as DAOerRanger, PRteam, etc do not alter the voting rights of the DAOists. Although DAOerRangers have more rights within the Discord server in order to administer it, all important changes must still be proposed and passed by the full panel of DAOists.

In the future, DAOists desire to expand ChaosDAO governance to also include Regulars in voting to further decentralize the organization and give weight to the opinions of more members.
