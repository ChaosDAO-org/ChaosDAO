## Contributing

### Software Developers:
Use a fork and pull request, pls


### Non-software developers:
You can edit the docs in this repo directly in the GitHub UI. Here's how:

1) Fork the main repo into your user space

2) Create a branch to do your edits on

3) Edit each file and paste in your modified text. This will create a new commit on your branch. (to avoid creating lots of commits, craft all of your text locally and then just paste it into a file all at once)

5) Submit your changes to GitHub by creating a "commit". Assuming you'll edit multiple files before being ready to merge the changes into the main repo/branch, you select "Commit directly to the "code_of_conduct" branch". In future if you want to do a PR after only changing a single file then it looks like they've got a cool Easy button for that.

6) Once you've edited all the files you want, you should create a "Pull Request" back into the ChaosDAO org's version of the repo to put your changes up for review. First, return to the main ChaosDAO project repo (final destination for your changes): https://github.com/ChaosDAO-org/ChaosDAO_docs

7) GitHub will automatically show you a nice button to create the pull request.

8) Fill out a title and description for your Pull Request. You probably want to add a Reviewer and mention in ChaosDAO that you've got a pull request ready for review.

9) After other people review and approve your changes, one of them should merge the pull request. That means your changes are merged into the `main` branch and are official documentation.
