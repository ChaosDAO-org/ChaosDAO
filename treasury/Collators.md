# Collators

ChaosDAO's primary revenue sources are from running collators on various Dotsama parachains in order to help secure the network. In general, any ChaosDAO project or collective investment using the ChaosDAO brand must contribute at least 10% of revenue to the ChaosDAO treasury. Any project using the ChaosDAO brand must receive approval by ChaosDAO governance.


## Joining a Collator
Often collators require a large self-bond in order to attempt to join the active set of collators to begin receiving block revenue. For these parachains (like Moonriver, Bifrost, Turing, Zeitgeist), outside people can then stake with a collator, so the external stake on a collator node is often much greater than the self-bond stake of collator owners/operators. This forms a larger barrier to entry. Therefore when ChaosDAO members pool their funds together to start a collator and then attract delegators, the set of contributors is fixed and their share of collator revenue is based on their initial contribution. The % revenue to ChaosDAO is also fixed at that point. Usually the ChaosDAO revenue portion is 10% where it is very difficult to get the node into the active set, but may be higher than 10% if there is a lot of demand for participation and a "Reverse Auction" format is used to determine who will contribute and how much the CD revenue share will be.

However, in permissionless competitive parachains where a collator can be "knocked out" , active participatnio is required by members/contributors and the overall ChaosDAO community in order to help keep the node in the active set. In these situations there may need to be an incentive to ensure active participation.

## Leaving a Collator
When the collator self-bond is fixed and the entire bond must be maintained in order for the collator to remain in the active set, if a collator contributor wishes to "cash out" then they must be bought out by someone else. This will be advertised and open to all ChaosDAO members. If there is heavy interest, an auction may be held to ensure fair distribution. If no one is interested in immediately buying out a collator stake, a person's collator self-bond contribution can also be slowly paid out from collator revenues, although this means that the self-bond amount is an illiquid long-term investment.
