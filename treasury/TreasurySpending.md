# Treasury Spending

### ChaosDAO Treasury Goals and Philosophy:
ChaosDAO's ideal use of CD treasury funding is to support the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem and community.

More specifically:
* Support common good code/tool development. We don’t think we have enough funds to significantly contribute yet, so CD is still an unfunded knowledge sharing tech innovation hub currently. For instance, subscrape. Taylor would love a Wordpress plugin. Spazcoin would love better multisig DAO tooling.
* Funding on-chain public identity for ChaosDAO as a generally impartial community organization (see Nomination Pools).
* Operating community infrastructure such as collators. To start with this has primarily been a revenue source for CD, but once people have bandwidth in the future, we can also support unprofitable collators to encourage decentralization. 

Some general guidelines to follow:

* Continue to build and grow the Treasury so that we can take on bigger challenges in the future. Never let expenditures be larger than recent revenue. Expect Polkadot ecosystem tokens to be worth much more in the bull market where we can do more with what we have slowly earned over time.
* Try to use the tokens within the ecosystem where they were earned (Astar, Moonriver).


### Expenditures from the ChaosDAO treasury so far:
* In Jan'22, DAOists approved sending half of our small MOVR treasury to the SuperColony "Ukranian Humanitarian Fund". About $1.6k (20 MOVR)
* In Nov'22, we created DOT and KSM "Nomination Pools" to support independent community-focused validators, using ~2 KSM and 225 DOT (out of ~650 DOT earned by the Interlay vault). We think this will show important public community leadership.

### Previously Rejected Proposals:
So far the following types of expenditures have not been accepted:
* Sending funds to specific individuals fleeing conflict. We definitely encourage individual donations, but this seemed like too much of a slippery slope with possible favoritism and not enough overall community benefit.
* Investing in seed rounds for individual projects
* Running a Kusama validator. Would be an awesome symbolic community move, but requires much more funds than we have available for a self-funded node. CD Community members couldn't even get half of the amount to self-fund it this summer, likely because rewards are very low. Maybe worth revisiting with the Nomination Pool.
* Evidently there was discussion of using some CD treasury funds for drinks at ~2022-09-25 CD meetup in London. I don’t recall it, and even now when I polled DAOists they were split. Buying a single round of drinks seems small and maybe good CD community building, but some DAOists still see it as not benefiting the overall ecosystem enough.



### Proposals for new CD Treasury Spending:
Treasury spending proposals tend to be contentious and complex. Therefore, individuals are encouraged to bring up the ideas in discussion forums and refine or develop the ideas with other individuals interested in the topic before making a formal spending proposal.

Due to the sensitive nature of treasury spending, final voting and approval of the expenditure is restricted to voting by DAOists only. At least 2/3 of current DAOists must affirmatively vote for the proposal in order for it to pass. DAOists, in your proposal please include the objective, total or recurring cost, what tokens or acct will be used, and how the spending will benefit the overall Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem.
