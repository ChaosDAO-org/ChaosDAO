In an effort to have formal, recorded votes on proposals put forth by the members of ChaosDAO, each DAOist has received a $DAOist token. This token will be used only for the purpose of recording votes, but it can be added to any given wallet with the contract address for the coin.

DAOist contract address: 0x1c50d2b719cd455d3fa23e86f36b51b87b5568d8

Initial governance votes will take place online via the DAOist token each member possesses. The DAOist token has 18 decimals which means 1 whole token is 10_000_000_000_000_000_000. Each DAOists possesses one DAOist token each with the exception of Alice und Bob, they have two tokens (since they are ultimately two people).

The website being used for this purpose will be Snapshot.org, which can be accessed here: https://snapshot.org/#/thechaosdao.eth

Any DAOist (should we include Regulars as well? Personally, I think they should be able to put forth proposals even if it is only DAOists who are voting on them) may use this link to put forth a proposal, using the interface below. Once a proposal has been put forth, please use the @ DAOists tag in the DAOist only channel to alert fellow members to log on to Snapshot.org to submit his/her vote.
(Although no other formal proposal has been submitted as of yet, I will put forth one in a couple of days once everyone has seen this rough draft and we can vote on accepting the parameters contained herein) 

Timeline: DAOists will be given 72 hours / 3 days to cast a vote for any given proposal.

Quorum: Although I am unsure if this can be added in the settings, I believe we should have at least 3/5s of the DAOists cast a vote; if 72 hours elapses or a quorum cannot be achieved, regardless of voting outcome, the proposal will be considered dropped/dead.
