# DAOerRanger

DAOerRangers are the technocrats of the ChaosDAO discord server. Just below server "owner", they have the ability to arrange channels, change permissions, and grant roles. However, they hold no more power or privilege than DAOists, simply being the technical implementers of the policies passed in votes by the DAOists.

The right to invite new members is reserved for the Scout role.
