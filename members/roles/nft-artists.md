# NFT Artists

NFT Artists are the creators of artwork on RMRKâ€™s Singular platform. They are essential members of the Dotsama community and ChaosDAO, often using their creative talents to aid the mission of the DAO and broader community in the Kusama ecosystem. Able to mint images, videos/GIFs, music tracks, or a combination thereof, our resident members can be identified by their pink colored Discord handles.
