# NFT Artists

NFT Artists are the creators of artwork on RMRKâ€™s Singular platform. They are essential members of the Dotsama community and ChaosDAO, often using their creative talents to aid the mission of the DAO and broader community in the Kusama ecosystem. Able to mint images, videos/GIFs, music tracks, or a combination thereof, our resident members can be identified by their pink colored Discord handles.

## Shilling
NFT artists often have a project or product to sell, but that should not be their primary discussion topic within ChaosDAO. A #shill-your-nfts channel has been created specifically for shilling so that we can receive these project updates without it overrunning other productive discussion in other channels. Outside the shill channel, we apply a 3:1 rule where a member must be submitting at least three non-shill posts per shill post. If artists are below this limit (shilling too much without contributing) then they will be put in #jail or asked to leave.
