# Youtubers

YouTubers are the members of our ChaosDAO community who produce video content related to the Dotsama ecosystem. They are often engaged in research, seeking out information on prospective parachains, promising dApps developing on certain protocols, or any other “alpha” which they then package and publish as videos on the YouTube platform.
