# Validators

Validators are highly esteemed members of the ChaosDAO community, as they provide an integral service to the entire Dotsama ecosystem. Running specialized nodes that verify or “validate” the transactions/information being packaged into blocks on the Polkadot or Kusama relay chains, validators secure the blockchain and ensure that the blocks that are produced are considered “canonical” by the rest of the validators striving to reach consensus.
