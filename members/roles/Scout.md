# Scout

One of the things that makes ChaosDAO unique is that it is a private discord with curated membership and a tightly controlled invite process. The ability to generate a new single-use invite link is reserved for the Scout role.

## Becoming a Scout
Once elevated to the role of DAOist, a DAOist member may volunteer for the role of Scout.

## Scout Responsibilities
The talent Scouts keep an eye out for active Polkadot ecosystem contributors across multiple communities and must actively participate in ongoing discussions and evaluations of potentional new members. This is their privilege, but also their responsibility. Although DAOerRangers as server admins techincally have the ability to generate invite links, the social process is that only Scouts should generate invite links. Although Scout discussion channels can be seen by all DAOists, some abilities such as commenting or emoji voting may be restricted to make sure that invite votes are only decided by the Scouts.

## Invite Process
Once Scouts have accepted that someone can be invited to join ChaosDAO, someone will contact that person to confirm that they are interested in joining. When a CD Discord invite is generated, it is generated for a single use and usually with a short time validity of 1-3 days. Invite links may be distributed to the invitee by any ChaosDAO member such as the original invite proposer, but are often distributed by DAOists.

## Scout Team Processes
Scouts use majority votes to approve invites. Each invite proposal is discussed in a separate thread.
