# Promotions and Demotions

Like most other ChaosDAO processes, promotions and demotions are handled by majority vote. For invites, this is a majority of ```Scouts```. For all other promotions and demotions, a majority of ```DAOists``` is required.

## Invites --> Frens
See the ```Scouts``` role. ```Scouts``` are DAOists given the ability to generate CD Discord invite links. A majority must vote in favor of an invite in order for the member to be invited. Once an invitee clicks on an invite and enters the server, they can see the about-us channel but can only interact in the introduction. Their first assignment is to write an introduction of themselves to the rest of the server (hisotry in crypto, hobbies, philosophy). Discussion and banter in the introduction channel is discouraged so that it stays clean. After a new invitee has posted their introduction, they are granted the ```Frens``` rank and gain visibility to most of the channels in the server, where all of the alpha is discussed. They are generally welcomed in the lounge channel.

## Frens --> Regular
Any of the ```DAOists``` can recommend promoting a member from ```Frens``` to ```Regulars``` based on consistent participation and contributions in ChaosDAO discussions. It can take only 1-2 months for very active members of ChaosDAO to be promoted from ```Frens``` to ```Regulars```, and sometimes it can take many months to be recognized as active enough to be nominated to be promoted to the ```Regulars``` role. Contribution and discussion across multiple areas in ChaosDAO is desirable instead of hanging out in only one channel. Self-promotion does not contribute to this evaluation and is in fact frowned upon (see 3:1 rule in the nft-artists area).

## Regular --> DAOist
Promotion to the ```DAOists``` is not at all linked to volume of commentary or length of time one has been a member of ChaosDAO. Instead, it is based on ideals, character, and organization contribution. Does the member help propel ChaosDAO forward and embody the causes that have brought us all together?

## DAOist --> DAOerRanger
```DAOists``` hold the voting power, but a few people are trusted to implement these policies in the Discord server. Those few people are the ```DAOerRangers```.

## DAOist --> Former DAOist
As our various interests wax and wane (especially in a bear market), some members inevitably will find more interesting work or discussion elsewhere. When any of the ```DAOists``` are no longer actively participating and voting in DAO governance, that DAOist may be 'promoted' to ```Former DAOist```. They will no longer have access to the DAOist-only governance channels and essentially will have the same rights as the ```Regulars``` role.

## Regular --> Fren
Periodically, ```DAOists``` will do an audit of when members last participated in discussions within the server. If someone hasn't meaningfully commented in the server for multiple months, they are likely to be eventually demoted back to ```Frens```. VIPs no longer have a special label but are more leniently left in the ```Regulars``` role if they attain it because we know their time is very valuable. VIPs who are invited to ChaosDAO but never become very active will only have the Frens role.

## Frens --> goodbye
Similar to ```Regulars``` -> ```Frens``` demotion, people can be exited fom the server if they disappear and are no longer active. To account for people who primarily watch or creep in the server, ```Frens``` being positioned to leave the server are first put in "jail" to see if they notice that they can no longer see the rest of the channels in the server.

## Jail
Instead of abrupt departures, ```DAOists``` have created a "jail" channel. If a member is in "jail" then they can only see that channel but no other channels in the server (to make it obvious something's wrong and they're in jail) while all other members can chat with them while they're in jail. This "jail" channel may be disguised as a satirical phrase such as "Cardano Luvers". If the situation causing the member to be in jail isn't resolved (change of behavior), the member may then after a few weeks be kicked from the server. 

## Reinstatement of Frens
For anyone who has been removed from the server due to inactivity (or voluntarily/accidentally left), they may be reinstated by contacting one of the ```DAOists```. As with all other promotions, a majority vote must pass to re-invite them.
