# History of ChaosDAO

In the sprint of 2021, Alice_und_Bob thought it would be a cool idea to gather together several people in the Polkadot ecosystem who were very active on social media, specifically Twitter and YouTube.
He created the ChaosDAO Discord server, originally named ____ and then began inviting specific individuals via Twitter DMs.

Discussions in the server originally revolved around NFT art collections and Kusama parachain crowdloans which started in June 2021. One area of interest that never came to fruition was decentralized on-chain governance. However, a basic hierarchy of positions was created for Frens, Regulars, and DAOists, with DAOists managing CD server governance via emoji voting within the Discord server.

In July 2021, Moon Bearer released his “ChaosDAO Apes” NFT collection, issuing a specialized NFT for each of the initial members of the CD server. Sort of our of jest, they agreed that anyone holding one of the ChaosDAO Apes would be granted access to the CD server (around 26 had been created so far, with a limit of 99 on the collection). One of the big draws of purchasing one of the apes was access to the “alpha” or insightful research and discussions of members within ChaosDAO.

During this time, CD members targeted inviting NFT artists (from RMRK’s Singular platform), very active Polkadot enthusiasts on social media, and developers like parachain project team members. As a result, ChaosDAO ended up being a curated private discord discussion forum with a mix of developers, shit posters, and investors (who bought their way in via the Apes).

In August 2021, there was excitement around the launch of the Karura (Acala) dex parachain, and then the Moonriver EVM parachain. This launched a frenzy of defi degeneracy, especially around the Solarbeam dex and the Moon Kafe auto-compounding service.

In late November 2021, ChaosDAO members joined together to fund a Moonriver collator as a collective investment but also as the first constant revenue stream to create a ChaosDAO treasury. CD members benefited from the discounted node operation services of Mayhem Nodes, advice from Alex Hartoum with Polkahaus, and whale stake from Donnie Big Bags to help us stay in the active set during our first experiences surviving “turbulence” of MOVR nodes competing to stay in the active set. Returns were estimated at 130%, with 2% going to Mayhem as the node operator, 10% to the ChaosDAO treasury, and the remaining 88% of collator revenue being paid out to the 12 contributors to the collator.

Also in November 2021, a group of OG “Ohmies” decided to fork the OHM project over to the Moonriver ecosystem and naming it “Rome”. Their objective was to first use the OHM codebase to start a reserve currency and then create a game to use the project token as the in-game currency. Rome organizers announced that people could organize themselves into Houses which would then govern through a Senate of elected representatives. Several members of ChaosDAO had already been interested in OHM and were excited to help with the launch of an OHM fork in the Dotsama ecosystem and therefore decided to petition to create one of the Houses of Rome which they named “House of Chaos”. Initial admins were all from ChaosDAO, but general membership was open and public. ChaosDAO members remained engaged with the Rome project, especially Kratistos as Moderator and bacchist as one of the Scholars of the Bank of Rome. Unfortunately, the Rome development team lost momentum trying to do do complex 3D graphics suited to use on a mobile phone and the Rome token price fell below the value of its treasury. Eventually vultures from elsewhere bought up Rome tokens and launched a successful governance attack because the distributed House→Senate→Snapshot governance vote pathway had never been finalized and therefore a simple Snapshot vote was able to be won by the new token holders in order to end the project and disburse current treasury holdings to token holders.

In Spring 2022, several ChaosDAO members were chatting in the #gm channel of ChaosDAO and came up with the idea to create a cheap Kusama parachain which would allow users to send and receive GM / GN messages, but whose ultimate intent was to be a test ground for lots of crazy ideas not tested by other parachain teams.

In Oct 2022, ChaosDAO experienced its first peaceful transition of power. Alice_und_Bob, the ChaosDAO founder, passed ownership of the server to ser Leemo who had been elected the new server owner. Likewise the Twitter acct was handed over to ThePhunky1 as the representative of the recently created PR Team.

In Nov-Dec 2022, ChaosDAO governance began to evolve to become more decentralized internally and to begin participating as an organization in the newly released "OpenGov" or "Gov 2.0" on the Kusama relay chain. First, DAOists figured out how to use a multisig wallet along with a proxy account to participate in governance votes and allow others to delegate voting power to the DAO's account. Second, the new Governance Operations Team posts on-chain governance referenda to the ChaosDAO Discord forums for internal voting by both DAOists and Regulars so that internal community votes could determine how the DAO's multisig would vote on Kusama referenda.
