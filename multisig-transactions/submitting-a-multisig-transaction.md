# Submitting A Multisig Transaction

#### Whoever initiates a multisig transaction is responsible for providing details of the transaction so that it can be verified and approved.

A simple transfer requires only the recipient address and amount of the transfer. More complicated extrinsics may require additional information, and a screenshot of the extrinsics page prior to submission is helpful.
